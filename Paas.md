#### Platform as a Service(Paas)

PaaS helps the world by making it easier and faster for businesses to build and launch apps without worrying about servers or hardware.

It saves money, supports new ideas, and helps industries grow with technology.


Some famous Paas,

- Amazon Web Service
- Microsoft Azure
- IBM Cloud
- Google Cloud

The most common types,

- Public PaaS
- Private Paas
- Hybrid Paas

##### Public PaaS:

Used for public clouds. Public PaaS providers offer tools for developers to manage servers and databases without dealing much with the underlying infrastructure.

PaaS runs on top of the provider's IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) in the public cloud.

Example: Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure App Service

##### Private PaaS:

A private PaaS option is similar to a public PaaS but maintains security. Used by organizations to provide internal resources to their developers.


Example: Red Hat OpenShift

##### Hybrid PaaS:

Combines public and private PaaS.  Hybrid PaaS provides infinite capacity provided by a public PaaS with cost efficiencies and owns internal infrastructure in private PaaS.

Example: IBM Cloud Pak


Paas services include,

- Information security
- Database integration
- Development team collaboration
- Application design and development
- Application testing and deployment
- Web service integration

In the future, PaaS will become smarter, more secure, and easier to use.

It will help new technologies like AI, IoT, and blockchain work faster.
