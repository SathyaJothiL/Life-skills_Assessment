### Good Practices for Software Development


##### Question-1 :

###### Points that were new to me:

* It is essential to  discuss my doubts in the team meeting itself since connecting with all  the members again is unlikely
* Seeking feedback is important to know whether everyone on the team is on the same page
* Using  group chat benefits everyone on the team
* When asking questions, I should ensure that it is easier for them to answer
* Use screencasts to explain my problems, so that it is easier for them to understand
* Be aware of the teammate’s schedule to know their availability for a meeting
* Maintain a healthy lifestyle by exercising and eating mindfully to focus on my work


##### Question 2

###### Areas I need to improve on:

* Communicate more clearly to align with company goals
* Improve team collaboration
* Minimize distractions while working.

###### Ideas to make progress:

* Ask specific and well-structured questions to get clear answers
* Engage with my teammates rather than focusing only on my work
* Follow the “work when you work, play when you play” rule to improve the quality of work
