### Tiny Habits

##### Question 1:

###### In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

In the video of BJ Fogg, two things amazed me the most,

###### From Doing to a Habit

* Starting with a simple task like 1 pushup a day
* Keep doing it regularly
* Making it into a big task like 10 pushups a day
* Finally forming it into a big habit

###### Forming new habits from old ones:

* New habit formation is affected by less motivation
* Starting with a known task to stay motivated
* Add old habits with small new habits

In this way, the threshold to form a new habit can be overcome

##### Question 2:

How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A, and P.

* B = Behaviour
* M = Motivation
* A = Ability
* P = Prompt

All three things are essential in forming a behavior B.

Motivation, the ability to do something, and the correct trigger are necessary to form a habit. Leaving one and having another would make a habit temporary and won't result in a long-term habit.

##### Question 3:

###### Why is it important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?

Saying things like “I am amazing” and “I did it” and doing a little dance after a task keeps us motivated to do more.

This small reward is important for learning new habits and helps us to do it happily.

##### Question 4:

###### In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The story of British bicycling who hadn't won a single game before 2010 to dominating sports is inspiring.

The team followed the concept of "marginal gains," by finding small areas for improvement like  nutrition, bicycle seats, recovery, and even sleep

By making these 1% improvements, they achieved remarkable results over time. This strategy contributed to their long-term success, eventually leading to multiple Olympic gold medals.

##### Question 5

###### What is the book's perspective about Identity?

* Focus on who you want to become, not what you want to achieve.
* Build habits for your desired identity.
* Instead of saying "I want to run," say "I am a runner."
* Identity-driven habits are more sustainable than goal-driven ones.

##### Question 6

###### Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?

1. Make the habit as easy as possible
2. Remove any obstacles for your habit
3. Make the environment suitable to support your habit
4. Use 2-minute rule to form a habit

##### Question 7

###### Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?

* Add steps that make the habit more difficult to do
* Remove triggers for bad habits
* Change into a healthy environment

##### Question 8:

###### Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

Steps to play piano often,

* I will place my piano in a visible spot to remind me to practice.
* I will set a goal to practice my favourite song
* I will start with small and easy pieces to keep me motivated
* I will record my playings and celebrate it to move onto learning next piece
